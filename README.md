## Features

- Modular quality management system
- Memory-efficient processing
- Comprehensive quality metrics
- Automated testing and verification
- Detailed documentation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-enhancer.git
cd image-enhancer
```

2. Run the project setup script:
```bash
bash scripts/project_setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create the project structure
- Install dependencies
- Initialize git repository
- Setup test infrastructure
- Configure error handling

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

This script:
- Cleans the environment
- Installs dependencies
- Runs verification
- Executes tests
- Deploys the application

### Development

1. Quality Management Components:
```python
from src.utils.quality_management import (
    QualityManager,
    BasicMetricsCalculator,
    ProcessingAccuracyAnalyzer,
    QualityImprovementAnalyzer,
    ConfigurationManager,
    PerformanceMetricsCalculator,
)

# Initialize quality manager
quality_manager = QualityManager()

# Process image
metrics = quality_manager.calculate_quality_metrics(image)
```

2. Running Tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test modules
pytest tests/test_basic_metrics.py
pytest tests/test_processing_accuracy.py
pytest tests/test_quality_improvement.py
```

## Memory Management

The system is designed for efficient memory usage:

1. Modular Components:
   - Each module handles specific calculations
   - Memory is allocated only when needed
   - Resources are properly cleaned up

2. Testing Approach:
   - Tests are split into focused modules
   - Memory usage is monitored
   - API throttling is prevented

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Efficient data structures
   - Resource cleanup
   - Batch processing support
