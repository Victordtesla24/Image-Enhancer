# Development Context

## Current State (Updated)

The Image Enhancer project is currently undergoing code quality improvements and testing. Initial verification has revealed several code quality issues that need to be addressed:

1. Code Style Issues:
   - Multiple files contain lines exceeding PEP 8's 79-character limit
   - Whitespace inconsistencies in some files
   - Unused imports across various modules
   - Unused local variables in several functions

2. Testing Status:
   - Test infrastructure is in place
   - Multiple test files present covering different components
   - Some test files have quality issues that need addressing

## Next Steps

1. Code Quality Improvements:
   - Fix all PEP 8 violations (line length, whitespace)
   - Remove unused imports and variables
   - Apply consistent code formatting across all files

2. Testing Enhancement:
   - Run full test suite after code quality fixes
   - Address any test failures
   - Improve test coverage where needed

3. Documentation Updates:
   - Update API documentation to reflect any changes
   - Ensure all code changes are properly documented
   - Review and update testing documentation

The focus is currently on bringing all code up to quality standards before proceeding with feature development or deployment.
