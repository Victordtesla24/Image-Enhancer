## Components

### Quality Management System

The quality management system is split into focused modules for better memory management and performance:

1. **QualityManager** (quality_manager.py)
   - Main orchestrator class
   - Coordinates between different components
   - Manages high-level quality analysis workflow

2. **BasicMetricsCalculator** (basic_metrics.py)
   - Handles basic image quality metrics
   - Calculates sharpness, contrast, detail, color, noise, texture, pattern
   - Memory-efficient metric calculations

3. **ProcessingAccuracyAnalyzer** (processing_accuracy.py)
   - Analyzes processing accuracy
   - Calculates SSIM, PSNR, feature preservation
   - Handles color accuracy analysis

4. **QualityImprovementAnalyzer** (quality_improvement.py)
   - Tracks quality improvements
   - Generates analysis feedback
   - Manages improvement metrics

5. **ConfigurationManager** (configuration.py)
   - Manages system configuration
   - Handles thresholds and settings
   - Maintains metrics history

6. **PerformanceMetricsCalculator** (performance_metrics.py)
   - Calculates performance-related metrics
   - Handles edge preservation, color consistency
   - Manages artifact detection

## Memory Management

The modular structure provides several memory optimization benefits:

1. **Component Isolation**
   - Each module handles specific calculations
   - Memory usage is contained within components
   - Resources are released after component execution

2. **Efficient Processing**
   - Calculations are performed in focused steps
   - Memory is allocated only when needed
   - Temporary results are cleaned up properly

3. **API Call Management**
   - Reduced risk of API throttling
   - Calculations are distributed across components
   - Better control over external service usage

## Data Flow

1. Image input → QualityManager
2. QualityManager coordinates with components:
   - BasicMetricsCalculator for basic metrics
   - PerformanceMetricsCalculator for advanced metrics
   - ProcessingAccuracyAnalyzer for accuracy analysis
   - QualityImprovementAnalyzer for improvement tracking
3. Results aggregated and returned
4. ConfigurationManager maintains state and history

## Extension Points

The modular architecture allows for easy extension:

1. **New Metrics**
   - Add new calculation methods to appropriate modules
   - Extend existing calculators or create new ones

2. **Custom Analysis**
   - Create new analyzer components
   - Integrate with existing workflow

3. **Configuration**
   - Extend configuration options
   - Add new thresholds and settings

## Best Practices

1. **Memory Management**
   - Release resources after use
   - Use efficient data structures
   - Implement proper cleanup

2. **Error Handling**
   - Each component handles its errors
   - Proper logging and reporting
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Component isolation for testing
   - Performance benchmarking
