# Testing Architecture

## Overview
The testing architecture is designed to ensure code quality, functionality, and maintainability across the project. Tests are organized by functionality to improve maintainability and execution efficiency.

## Test Organization

### Quality Management Tests
The quality management test suite is split into multiple focused files:

1. `conftest.py`
   - Contains shared fixtures used across quality management tests
   - Provides test image generation utilities
   - Manages QualityManager instance creation

2. `test_basic_metrics.py`
   - Tests for basic quality metrics calculation
   - Individual metric validation
   - Value range verification

3. `test_processing_accuracy.py`
   - Processing accuracy analysis tests
   - Metrics comparison validation
   - Accuracy scores calculation

4. `test_quality_improvement.py`
   - Quality improvement analysis
   - Analysis feedback generation
   - Improvement metrics validation

5. `test_edge_cases.py`
   - Edge case handling
   - Error condition testing
   - Boundary value analysis

6. `test_configuration.py`
   - Configuration validation
   - History tracking tests
   - Threshold verification

7. `test_performance_metrics.py`
   - Performance-related metrics testing
   - Artifact level analysis
   - Dynamic range verification

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
Tests can be executed:
- All at once: `pytest tests/`
- By category: `pytest tests/test_basic_metrics.py`
- With specific markers: `pytest -m "not slow"`

### Memory Management
- Tests are split to reduce memory usage
- Each test file focuses on specific functionality
- Prevents API throttling issues

## Best Practices
1. Keep test files focused and manageable
2. Use shared fixtures from conftest.py
3. Follow naming conventions for test files and functions
4. Include appropriate assertions and error checks
5. Document test purposes and requirements

## Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Coverage requirements must be met
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
